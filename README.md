Stachestrap
========

Stachestrap is an extension to Twitter Bootstrap. It includes:

- Natural Language Forms
- Cards
- Flipping Cards
- Additional styles for Wells
- and more (soon)

Installation
========

Stachestrap has the following dependencies:

- bootstrap.min.css
- bootstrap.min.js
- whatever jquery library bootstrap is dependant on
- fontawesome

Note: You do not need to load the minified versions of those libraries.

Add the following to your project:

- stachestrap.css
- strachestrap.js

Make sure to load stachestrap.css beneath boostrap.min.css in your file so that any overrides can work.

Most of Stachestrap so far is not dependant on stachestrap.js. The javascript included enhances some elements and is needed for others, but all in all Stachestrap aims to be developed in a way that relys heavily on CSS and minimally on JS.

This is a work in progress and has so far only been tested in Chrome. Please feel free to contribute.
